# A27R (Aryan27Mathur) Notes

Overall the site looks great! Just putting my initial notes down in this readme and this branch, still pretty iffy with git but thought it was best to put stuff like visual notes here

### Pages that seem missing

- http://localhost:3000/automotive/registration
- http://localhost:3000/automotive/loans
- http://localhost:3000/automotive/insurance
- http://localhost:3000/automotive/buy-sell
- http://localhost:3000/automotive/deployment

These are links I got to by pressing the buttons in `http://localhost:3000/Services`

My reccomendation is probably to switch to using Next.JS for the frontend at some point, its just easier for making frontend changes that are content related

For backend I see you link the transportation website to each state using the react-maps library which is really cool! I tried it with `https://azdot.gov/` cuz W Arizona

Deploying this site to a web hosting servie would also be pretty easy, I use `vercel.com` since it has a good free version but you as github owner actually have to go through a bunch of steps to get that set up, if we switch to using Next.JS for the website that'll be like a 1 hour thing.

## Future Ideas (For the Bigger Pages like Discount Database)

I could probably start web scraping some stuff but I did find this site `id.me` seems like it shows a lot of the benefits avaialble

After logging in with my gmail I went to the government benefits tab and just selected all the options, here's a chatgpt summary of the index page (we can format it better later)
